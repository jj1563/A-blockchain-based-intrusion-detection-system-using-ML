— The Blockchain - Machine Learning Integration (BMLI) proposes a decentralized approach to data processing and security for edge devices by integrating machine learning (ML) algorithms and blockchain technology. The Blockchain mechanism provides an immutable decentralized ledger that helps in storing various data and are linked together by cryptographic hashes. The utilization of blockchain in edge devices is to store the data that are sensitive to any intrusion that occur due to unauthorized access from an unauthenticated user. This paper examines the use of blockchain mechanism which are machine learning programs are used at various fields that helps in protecting and securing the data from any external modification or unauthorized access by the people outside the organization to enable integrity and confidentiality. This paper also discusses about the various algorithms that are used in the identification and classification of the data that is labelled under various categories that involves private sensitive data as-well-as typical data that doesn’t need any high alert. Furthermore, it discusses the various methods that are used in integrating machine learning algorithms with blockchain.
